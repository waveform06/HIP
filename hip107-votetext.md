- Full HIP Text: [HIP-107](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/ad0b6602b4f3888733e94a89bb2a96541f41a1bc/0107-preventing-gaming-within-the-mobile-subdao.md)

## Proposal Details:

The primary Service Provider and company that reviews CPI information, Nova Labs (d.b.a. Helium Mobile), has expressed concern for ongoing gaming that they've identified within the MOBILE subnetwork; however, they do not have the appropriate authority to stop this from occurring. This HIP will give MOBILE subDAO Service Providers the authority needed to curb gaming.
