## Summary:
This Helium Improvement Proposal (HIP) is an amendment of [HIP 85](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0085-mobile-hex-coverage-limit.md) to create separate Hex Limits for both Outdoor Wi-Fi and Outdoor CBRS. Each signal (Wi-Fi or CBRS) will have its own limits, meaning adding a CBRS signal to a res12 hex with pre-established Wi-Fi coverage will not negatively impact rewards.

The information within this HIP will supersede HIP 85 upon passing, thus creating one centralized HIP that documents Hex Limits for both Wi-Fi and CBRS deployments. 


## Related Previous HIPs

* [HIP 74](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0074-mobile-poc-modeled-coverage-rewards.md) established modeled coverage for the MOBILE subDAO.
* [HIP 85](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0085-mobile-hex-coverage-limit.md) implemented CBRS Hex limits.
* [HIP 93](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0093-addition-of-wifi-aps-to-mobile-subdao.md) introduced the addition of Wi-Fi access points and certain limitations.

## Motivation:
[HIP 93](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0093-addition-of-wifi-aps-to-mobile-subdao.md) introduced Wi-Fi APs as a new way to stay connected to the Helium MOBILE network; however, the HIP did not cover all gaming concerns, and introduced new vectors for farming MOBILE. Additionally, [HIP 85](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0085-mobile-hex-coverage-limit.md) established CBRS Hex Limits that didn't apply to Wi-Fi, as Wi-Fi had not been rolled out yet. This HIP proposes imposing the same hex limits between unique Wi-Fi coverage and unique CBRS coverage. 


## Stakeholders:
Deployers - This HIP will make it more fair for deployers who are able to deploy a more optimal Wi-Fi AP and CBRS setup than current existing setups. 

Subscribers - Subscribers may see more coverage of Wi-Fi access as this HIP will encourage Wi-Fi deployments to not be bunched together. 

Service Providers - If better Wi-Fi coverage is added due to this HIP, Service Providers will see an increased amount of data being offloaded onto the Helium 5G network.

## Hex Limits

### Indoor Wi-Fi
[HIP 93](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0093-addition-of-wifi-aps-to-mobile-subdao.md) established a limit of one (1) Wi-Fi AP per res12 hex will be eligible for PoC rewards. This will remain the limit for Indoor Wi-Fi APs. 

### Outdoor Wi-Fi 

Currently, any redundant and overlapping Outdoor Wi-Fi coverage is still rewarded the same as non-overlapping coverage under [HIP 93](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0093-addition-of-wifi-aps-to-mobile-subdao.md). This discourages the buildout of coverage to new areas. To prevent overcrowding and overlapping of Wi-Fi coverage in hexes, this HIP proposes to limit the amount of Modeled Coverage Points (MCP) Outdoor Wi-Fi AP receives for redundant outdoor Wi-Fi coverage in res12 hexes. 

To ensure that only the best setups are rewarded, only the top three (3) ranked signals of Outdoor Wi-Fi APs in each res12 hex will be awarded MCP, with a decaying multiplier based on the AP rank noted below. Any AP not ranked within the top three (3) will be ranked as “Fail”, and receive no MCP for that res12 hex. Please note, these ranks below are only assigned to Wi-Fi APs. Therefore, adding one (1) CBRS radio to this equation will not result in less rewards for Wi-Fi.

| Wi-F Rank    |Multiplier   |  
|--------------|-------------|
|      1       |   1X        |
|      2       |  .75X       |
|      3       |  .25X       |
|    Fail      |   0X        |

Please note that the multiplier table above only affects the MCP that are given to each Outdoor Wi-Fi AP and does not affect rewards distributed for the transfer of data.


### Indoor CBRS Limits
This HIP proposes implementing a similar res12 hex limit established in [HIP 93](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0093-addition-of-wifi-aps-to-mobile-subdao.md) to CBRS Radios, whereas this HIP limits the amount of indoor CBRS radios per res12 hex to 1. Further, Coverage Claim Time (noted in the "Ranking & Criteria" below) will be used to determine which indoor CBRS radio will be rewarded PoC. 

### Outdoor CBRS Limits
[HIP 85](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0085-mobile-hex-coverage-limit.md) established outdoor limits for CBRS Radios, which will not change in this HIP. The ranks noted for CBRS from HIP 85 are noted below, and only applicable to Outdoor CBRS Radios and not Wi-Fi.


| CBRS Rank    |Multiplier   |  
|--------------|-------------|
|      1       |   1X        |
|      2       |  .75X       |
|      3       |  .25X       |
|    Fail      |   0X        |


#### Ranking & Criteria

All Outdoor Wi-Fi APs and Outdoor CBRS radios that provide coverage to a single res12 hex will be given a Wi-Fi Rank and or CBRS Rank for each res12 hex they provide coverage in based on the following potential attributes (note, this rank is only for a single res12 hex and not the entire AP or radio):

- Modeled Signal Strength 
- Coverage Claim Time (Only used as a tiebreaker for Modeled Single Strength)

If there are more than 1 Outdoor Wi-Fi AP with the same signal strength level, the `coverage_claim_time` value will be used to rank the top 3 oldest installations where `coverage_claim_time` is the timestamp when the Wi-Fi AP was asserted in that hex. The oldest Wi-Fi AP will receive the higher rank, while the newest will receive the lowest rank. To prevent rewarding "dead" Wi-Fi APs, we propose to reset `coverage_claim_time` if the Wi-Fi AP was not generating a Heartbeat for more than 72 hours and use the time of the last Heartbeat as the new `coverage_claim_time`.

Note: As the Wi-Fi Rank and CBRS Rank are independent, adding CBRS coverage within a res12 hex that already has coverage from Wi-Fi will not impact earnings of the Wi-Fi signals.


#### Modeling Wi-Fi AP Ranking

See the example below of how ranking based on a hex multiplier would affect deployment of five (5) Outdoor Wi-Fi APs and five (5) Outdoor CBRS radios if they are providing modeled coverage to the same res12 hex:

| Wi-Fi    | Signal Strength | Coverage Claim Start Date | Wi-Fi Rank | MCP per HIP 93 | New MCP |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------|---------|
| A        | -63.33 dBm      | 01/01/2024 01:01:01       | 1          | 16             | 16      |
| B        | -66.75 dBm      | 01/01/2024 01:01:01       | 2          | 8              |  6      |
| C        | -66.75 dBm      | 02/12/2024 18:06:05       | 3          | 8              |  2      |
| D        | -75.60 dBm      | 01/02/2024 01:01:01       | Fail       | 4              |  0      |

| Radio    | Signal Strength | Coverage Claim Start Date | CBRS Rank  | MCP Per HIP 74 | New MCP |  
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------|---------|
|   A      |   -77.33 dBm    |05/01/2023 23:24:25        | 1          | 16             | 16      |
|   B      |   -98.75 dBm    |12/01/2022 01:01:01        | 2          | 8              | 6       |
|   C      |   -98.75 dBm    |12/02/2022 12:11:01        | 3          | 8              | 2       |
|   D      |   -105.60 dBm   |12/05/2022 11:51:01        | Fail       | 4              | 0       |


**Table Key:**
- **Wi-Fi/CBRS:** Example Wi-Fi AP / radio name.
- **Signal Strength:** The Signal Strength of the res12 hex from the modeled coverage explorer.
- **Coverage Claim:** The date/time that the Coverage Claim period started.
- **Wi-Fi/CBRS Rank:** The assigned rank based on which Wi-Fi AP and CBRS Radio has the strongest Signal Strength (or Coverage Claim if tied for Signal Strength).
- **Coverage Points Per HIP 93:** The amount of MCP currently awarded under HIP 93.
- **New Coverage Points:** The amount of MCP that would be awarded under this HIP.

**Table Explanation:**

Since Wi-Fi AP / Radio A has the highest signal strength in that hex, it will be ranked as "1", and granted a 1X multiplier to the modeled coverage score of 16, which will award it with the full 16 (16 x 1) MCP for that epoch.

Since Wi-Fi AP and Radio B and C tied in Signal Strength, the Coverage Claim date is used to determine which radio is ranked next. For this example, radio B had its Coverage Claim date start on 01/01/2024 01:01:01 while radio C had its Coverage Claim date start on 02/12/2024 18:06:05. Therefore, since Wi-Fi AP B has an earlier Coverage Claim date, it will be ranked "2", while Wi-Fi AP C has a rank of "3".

Since Wi-Fi AP and Radio D had the lowest signal strength out of all four (4) Wi-Fi AP, and only the top three (3) Wi-Fi AP will earn PoC rewards, Wi-Fi AP D will not earn any MCP for this res12 hex, and are ranked as "Fail".

### Outdoor CBRS and Outdoor Wi-Fi Signal Interference
Too much CBRS and Wi-Fi overlap may cause interference, and not provide the best or even usable experience for end users. Therefore, This HIP proposes that any res12 hex that has greater than four (4) outdoor CBRS signals or greater than four (4) outdoor Wi-Fi signals, shall not be awarded modeled coverage points for that res12 hex that has greater than four (4) signals.

See the example below for an instance where five (5) CBRS and four (4) Wi-Fi signals share the same res12 hex:


| Radio    | Signal Strength | Coverage Claim Start Date | CBRS Rank  | MCP Per HIP 85| New MCP |  
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------|---------|
|   A      |   -77.33 dBm    |05/01/2023 23:24:25        | 1          | 16            | 0       |
|   B      |   -98.75 dBm    |12/01/2022 01:01:01        | 2          | 6             | 0       |
|   C      |   -98.75 dBm    |12/02/2022 12:11:01        | 3          | 2             | 0       |
|   D      |   -105.60 dBm    |12/05/2022 11:51:01       | Fail       | 0             | 0       |
|   E      |   -105.69 dBm    |08/01/2022 05:01:59       | Fail       | 0             | 0       |

| Wi-Fi    | Signal Strength | Coverage Claim Start Date | Wi-Fi Rank | MCP per HIP 93| New MCP |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------|---------|
| A        | -63.33 dBm      | 01/01/2024 01:01:01       | 1          | 16            | 16      |
| B        | -66.75 dBm      | 01/01/2024 01:01:01       | 2          | 8             |  6      |
| C        | -66.75 dBm      | 02/12/2024 18:06:05       | 3          | 8             |  2      |
| D        | -75.60 dBm      | 01/02/2024 01:01:01       | Fail       | 4             |  0      |


## Drawbacks:
Implementing this proposal will increase the complexity of modeled coverage scores due to adding additional variables used to calculate total MOBILE rewards.

## Rationale and Alternatives:
An alternative would be allowing Wi-Fi APs to keep earning the defined amount of MCP as described in HIP 93. 

However, this may prevent or stagnate the network's growth because HIP 93 does not incentivize deployment of Wi-Fi AP to minimize overlapping coverage. 

## Deployment Impact:
As [HIP 74](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0074-mobile-poc-modeled-coverage-rewards.md) has already been deployed by Nova Labs, Nova Labs is able to change the chain variables to implement this HIP.

## Success Metrics: 
This HIP is successful if: General consensus is that the coverage ratio between CBRS and WiFi AP is “fair” and that multilayered coverage is achieved in an efficient manner.
