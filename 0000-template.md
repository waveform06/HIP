# HIP Template (Give it a title here but do not allocate a number, HIP editors will allocate a number)
Please edit the document to see all the assistance notes.
Questions and assistance notes should be removed when answered.

- Author(s): <!-- your GitHub @usernames and links, Authors should support all of the HIP not just contribute parts of a HIP. They should be able to take ownership of the HIP -->
- Start Date: <!-- fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD -->
- Category: <!-- economic, technical, governance, economic affects income or price, technical requires work or programming, governance is about process-->
- Original HIP PR: <!-- leave this empty; maintainer will fill in ID of this pull request -->
- Tracking Issue: <!-- leave this empty; maintainer will create a discussion issue -->
- Vote Requirements: <!-- veHNT Holders, veIOT Holders, or veMOBILE Holders -->

## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the proposal.

<!-- Read the content requests in all sections before starting to write any section. 
For Summary: What does the HIP do?, and this can include a simplified why -->

### Disclosure

This section is requested if the HIP author has a close connection with Nova Labs, the Helium Foundation or a commercial identity that is not obvious from the HIP content.
<!-- Eg. Is the HIP author being paid or contracted by an organization/identity to write this HIP?
Or if they do work for an organization/identity, that this HIP is separate from their employment or association with the organization. 
The author(s) can identify which stakeholder(s) apply to them.  --> 

## Motivation

- Why are we doing this? <!-- A more detailed why this HIP was created -->
- What use cases does it support? <!-- The current scenarios, situations -->
- What problems does it solve?
- What is the expected outcome? <!-- If the problem is solved what is the result -->

## Stakeholders

- Who is affected by this HIP? A stakeholder is any individual, group, or party such as network
  users, Hotspot hosts, or token holders.
  <!-- If it's obvious they are positively or negatively affected by the HIP then confirm this -->
- How are we soliciting feedback on this HIP from these stakeholders? Note that they may not be
  watching the HIP repository or even directly active in the Helium Community chat channels.
  <!-- Stakeholders need to know this HIP exists, are the authors contacting them for comment? -->

## Detailed Explanation

- Introduce and explain new concepts.
- It should be reasonably clear how the proposal would be implemented.
- Provide representative examples that show how this proposal would be commonly used.
- Corner cases should be dissected by example.
- Provide graphs, tables, scenarios to suit imprtant stakeholders

## Drawbacks

- Why should we _not_ do this? <!-- What other alternatives are there? -->
- What problems could occur if we do this?
  <!-- Who are the negatively affected stakeholders? and how are they affected?
- What additional actions need to be taken by stakeholders they did not have to perform before -->

## Rationale and Alternatives

This is your chance to discuss your proposal in the context of the whole design space. This is
probably the most important section!

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
  <!-- How are stakeholders affected by not doing this HIP? -->

## Unresolved Questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the HIP process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this HIP that could be addressed in the
  future independently of the solution that comes out of this HIP?
- Are there dependencies, milestones, or dates that need to be met for this HIP to succeed?

## Deployment Impact
Describe how this design will be deployed and any potential impact it may have on current users of
this project.
<!-- Who will implement this HIP, the authors? Is Nova or Foundation requested to implement this HIP? 
HIPs need someone to agree to implement the HIP before they can go to vote -->

- How will current users be impacted?
- How will stakeholders be impacted
- How will existing documentation/knowledge base need to be supported? Any content to change at
  <http://docs.helium.com>? Who will make this content change?
- Is this backwards compatible? Can this HIP be undone?
  - If not, what is the procedure to migrate?

## Success Metrics

What metrics can be used to measure the success of this design? Are any new Dune or Topledger reports needed to
measure the success? 
- What period do we measure this over, is it compared to a previous period?
- What should we measure to prove a performance increase?
- What should we measure to prove an improvement in stability?
- What should we measure to prove a reduction in complexity?
- What should we measure to prove an acceptance of this by its users?
